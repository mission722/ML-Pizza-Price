This repository contains a simple yet delicious project - a Pizza Price Prediction model using Machine Learning. If you've ever wondered how much your dream pizza might cost based on its size and the number of toppings, this project is for you! Using a scenario-based dataset that includes the pizza size (small, medium, or large) and the number of toppings, our model predicts the price with the help of a linear regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.


## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic example of using machine learning to predict pizza prices based on certain features. We employed the Linear Regression model from scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to train the model. The model takes input from the user in terms of pizza size (small, medium, large) and the number of toppings, and then it predicts the price of the pizza.
Number of topping represents the number of layers in pizza

## Main Objective
#### The Main Objective of this code is to learn Machine Learning deeply its an basic predictor but it gives an idea how things works in Machine Learning or You can use it for predicting your pizza price üòâ and you can modify the dataset and train the model accordingly Good Luck


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of three columns:

- **Size**: This column represents the size of the pizza (0 for small, 1 for medium, and 2 for large).
- **Toppings**: The number of toppings the user wants on their pizza.
- **Price**: The corresponding price of the pizza based on the size and toppings.

The dataset is scenario-based and was created for the purpose of this project.

## Installation

1. ### Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/mission722/ML-Pizza-Price.git


2. ### Or you can Download It Directly

3. ### You need to install some library before you can run your code which are:-
    - **scikit-learn**
    - **pandas**

4. ### If you dont know how to install it then here is steps:-
    - **open cmd**
    - **Type this :-**
        - pip install scikit-learn
        - pip install pandas


## Uses

1. ### It will first ask you the size for the pizaa you have option for small , medium , large if you want more size you need to modify dataset

2. ### It will ask you the number of toppings you want in your pizza topping means number of layers in pizza

3. ### The model will then predict the price of the pizza based on your inputs.

## Results

After providing the pizza size and the number of toppings, the model will display the predicted price of the pizza. Keep in mind that this is a simplified model and the predictions might not be perfectly accurate in real-world scenarios.
